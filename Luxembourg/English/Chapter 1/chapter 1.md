## 1. Introduction

This guideline to copyright in the Luxembourg heritage sector is written to develop an understanding of the potential difficulties that arise when heritage institutions work towards enabling public online access to their digital and digitised collections and accompanying descriptive information. With this guideline you will be able to grasp the main challenges for the sector related to intellectual property (IP) rights and you will be in a position to develop policies to address those issues.

An understanding of copyright and related rights has become necessary for all employees of heritage institutions that work in the digitised world. Not only is our analog heritage digitised, most new heritage is born digital. Besides, interactions with heritage are quickly becoming digital through services like online catalogues, online collections and digital heritage portals. Our understanding of what we can do with that digital heritage from a legal perspective to fulfill our mission is essential for an innovative sector.

Copyright and related rights play an important part in our market economy. These rights are granted to creators to provide an incentive to create original works and provide opportunities to remunerate their labour and creativity. The heritage sector works within the framework, however, at the same time the heritage sector has a public mission to collect, preserve and make available our culture’s memories, cultural productions and knowledge in the best way possible to serve our society to learn and understand where we come from to plan our future.[^1] 

This creates an interplay between the desire to consume our society’s creative productions and the need to compensate the creators. The argument is that, if the protection that copyright grants us is sufficient, creative productions will continue to flourish. This rationale works most of the time. Yet, copyright is not so finely tuned that it works in all aspects of our society. The balance between the rights of the creators and rights of the users is delicate. Especially the digitised heritage sector can suffer from a disbalance of these rights when serving its public mission. 

“There are laws and practical objections between dreams and actions”.	

– From the Dutch poem ‘Marriage’ by Willem Elsschot (our translation)

That copyright and related rights create barriers for the heritage sector is a product of this rationale. This guideline will help you understand how copyright works in your sector, how to work with questions like when rights expire, or when an exception to copyright can be used to work with heritage objects from your collection.

Most importantly it will provide tools to help you make a risk assessment when this disbalance between the rights of the creators are on par with the common practice of the heritage sector.

This guideline first introduces the structure of copyright and related rights, and its international basis (See chapter 

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "2. Intellectual property in Luxembourg"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[2. Intellectual property in Luxembourg](#heading=h.qh9fs22uc1tm)). The guideline continues with a discussion of copyright for the heritage sector (See chapter 

<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "3. Copyright"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[3. Copyright](#heading=h.nlbxijykncum)) and rights of performing artists (See chapter 

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "4. Neighbouring rights"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[4. Neighbouring rights](#heading=h.gsbcafkn0s6b)). This is followed by a discussion of relevant exceptions and limitations to these rights (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "5. Exceptions and limitations to copyright and neighbouring rights"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[5. Exceptions and limitations to copyright and neighbouring rights](#heading=h.xdpporfbg2gv)). The guideline then discusses those rights that are related to copyright and are applicable when dealing with digital heritage. (See chapter 

<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "6. Database rights"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[6. Database rights](#heading=h.mxpv1vwm5fqo), chapter 

<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "7. Design rights"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[7. Design rights](#heading=h.nywvo2au9prs), and chapter 

<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "8. Portrait rights"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[8. Portrait rights](#heading=h.4vyy6n65zmq6)).

There are also obligations for the heritage institutions, besides the rights of the creators and rightsholders. These deal with the unique position of public institutions in our society (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "9. Public Sector Information"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[9. Public Sector Information](#heading=h.2zlkw467ddss)), the role of platforms on the Internet (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "10. Intermediary liability"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[10. Intermediary liability](#heading=h.teanybp1nrgp)), and aspects of processing personal information (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "11. General Data Protection Regulation"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[11. General Data Protection Regulation](#heading=h.sdah0mcwgh9y)).

This extensive legal framework informs the decisions that heritage institutions need to make when making their collections available to a digital audience. It is unavoidable that heritage institutions take measured risks given the complex nature of this legal framework (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "12. Risk assessment"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[12. Risk assessment](#heading=h.o3dmxlxfdqt9)). These risks can become more manageable when following the practical guides that this guideline proposes (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "13. Practical measures"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert13">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[13. Practical measures](#heading=h.r420ta8jdas8)). The guideline concludes with a set of forward looking policy recommendations that will assist the Luxembourg heritage sector in making as much heritage available as possible (see chapter 

<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "14. Policy recommendations"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[14. Policy recommendations](#heading=h.rg8384it13x7)).
